The month with the most campaigns launched was May, followed by june and july. A similar distribution is found in the number of succesful campaigns, peaking in May with 111, and following a downwards trend throughout the rest of the year.

## Descriptive analysis of succesful and failed US theater campaigns.

In order for a campaign to be succesful, a reasonable and sufficient goal must be placed, hoping to get enough money pledged, and this may be one of the most critical problems in the whole project. By analyzing the goals and comparing it with the amount of money pledged in both succesful and failed campaigns in the US, we found than the mean goal in succesful campaigns was $5,049.00, with a median of $3,000.00. This in contrast to failed campaigns with a mean goal of $10,554.00, and a median of $5,000.00. Being true that failed campaigns ask for more money, we find that it was not the sole determining factor of a campaign's succes, due to a right deviation of the mean goal in failed campaigns. More importantly, the amount of money pledged in failed campaigns is strikingly lower than in succesful ones, meaning that there were different factors other than money involved in the campaign's failure.

## CONCLUSIONS.

This project is inspired in by other plays that have been proven to be succesful, and the markets intended for the play are one of the strongest. We determine that in order to maximize the chances of succes, the goal must be set under $2,000.00
